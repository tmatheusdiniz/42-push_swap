## 🗣️ About
<b>Push_Swap</b> is a sorting algorithm project designed to efficiently sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an optimal sorting strategy while minimizing the number of moves. The project involves manipulating two stacks (Stack A and Stack B) and applying operations such as swapping, pushing, and rotating, reverse rotate etc.

> I chose the turk algorithms for making this project, because it's efficient algorithm and haven't a hard implementation.
